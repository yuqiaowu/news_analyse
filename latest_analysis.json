  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Global macro liquidity is moderately loose (DXY weakening, active JPY carry trade), supportive of risk assets. However, market sentiment is currently dominated by short-term negative news.\n\n**Analysis Summary:** The market is experiencing a divergence between macro support (loose liquidity) and near-term negative narratives (ETF outflows). Although a weaker DXY and lower US Treasury yields create a favorable environment, the Glassnode report on institutional disengagement is suppressing price action. Bitcoin faces short-term pressure but is structurally supported by corporate treasury expansion (Matador). Ethereum is fundamentally bullish, as whale accumulation (Trend Research) outweighs the short-term ETHZilla liquidation event. Given the overall loose liquidity, the current decline (with low RSI readings) is likely a 'Buy the Dip' opportunity rather than the start of a major correction, suggesting a short-term consolidation phase until macro tailwinds reassert dominance.",
