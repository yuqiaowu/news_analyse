  "global_summary_cn": "当前宏观流动性环境表现为“倾向风险偏好”。美联储降息预期持续走低（-8.8 bps），叠加日元疲软驱动的套利交易，为风险资产提供了充足的流动性燃料。叙事层面，市场情绪极其乐观，主要由以太坊现货质押ETF的积极进展和机构$500M比特币购买计划驱动。这种“流动性支持+极强利好叙事”的结合，形成了看涨的完美风暴，支撑了BTC和ETH的强劲上涨。市场结构上，ETH涨幅领先 (+6.32%)，反映出鲸鱼大规模做多及ETF预期升温。短期风险在于即将到来的FOMC会议可能引发波动，但总体基本面势头强劲，建议保持高风险偏好。",
  "global_summary_en": "The current macro liquidity environment is leaning \"Risk On.\" Persistent downward trends in Fed rate expectations (-8.8 bps) combined with a weak Yen driving carry trade flows provide ample liquidity fuel for risk assets. On the narrative layer, sentiment is extremely optimistic, primarily driven by the positive developments surrounding the staked Ethereum ETF filings and aggressive institutional plans to acquire $500M in Bitcoin. This combination of \"Supportive Liquidity + Extremely Strong Bullish Narrative\" creates a Perfect Storm for continuation, supporting the strong rise in BTC and ETH. ETH is currently leading the rally (+6.32%), reflecting massive whale long positioning and escalating ETF anticipation. The near-term risk remains high volatility surrounding the upcoming FOMC meeting, but the overall fundamental momentum is robust, favoring high risk appetite.",
