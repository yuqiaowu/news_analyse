  "global_summary_cn": "宏观流动性信号目前存在冲突。尽管美联储利率预期趋于鸽派且美国CPI数据低于预期，英国央行也已降息，这些都是对风险资产强劲的利好叙事。然而，美元指数（DXY）走强和VIX指数上升显示出短期流动性收紧的压力，市场风险偏好受限。这种宏观利好叙事与流动性收紧的矛盾，加上高达5.53亿美元的以太坊ETF资金流出，导致市场出现明显的“卖事实”或派发行为。当前加密货币普遍下跌，RSI接近超卖区域，显示出技术面的疲软和短期结构性压力。市场处于分歧阶段，潜在的多头正在消化抛售压力，需关注关键支撑位。",
  "global_summary_en": "Macro liquidity signals are currently conflicted. Although the Fed rate expectations are dovish, US CPI data came in softer than anticipated, and the Bank of England cut rates—all strong bullish narratives for risk assets. However, the stronger DXY and rising VIX indicate short-term tightening liquidity pressure, restricting market risk appetite. This divergence between bullish macro narratives and liquidity tightening, compounded by a significant $553 million Ether ETF outflow, has led to noticeable 'Sell the News' behavior or distribution. Cryptocurrencies are broadly down, with RSIs approaching oversold territory, indicating technical weakness and short-term structural pressure. The market is in a divergence phase, where potential buyers are absorbing selling pressure. Key support levels must be watched closely.",
