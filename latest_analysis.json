  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态目前处于**混合/略微收紧**阶段。尽管美联储的利率预期显示出鸽派倾向（5D下降14.3基点），且日元持续疲软支持套利交易（风险偏好），但美元指数（DXY）意外走强至98.71，构成了宏观流动性的主要阻力。新闻面同样复杂：一方面，比特币技术指标显示周线RSI已跌至自$15K以来最超卖水平，存在潜在反弹动能；另一方面，以太坊遭遇了高达$5.53亿的大额ETF资金流出，对即时市场情绪构成了强烈的看跌冲击。此外，Terraform对Jump Trading的40亿美元诉讼增加了法律不确定性。由于流动性未完全宽松且高影响力的利空新闻（ETH流出）占主导地位，市场短期内可能继续处于**谨慎整合**阶段，直至DXY趋势逆转或资金流出放缓。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity status is currently **Mixed/Slightly Tightening**. Although the Fed's rate expectations show a dovish tilt (5D drop of 14.3 bps) and persistent Yen weakness supports carry trade (Risk On), the unexpected strength of the DXY, currently at 98.71, poses a major hurdle for macro liquidity. The news narrative is equally complex: technically, Bitcoin's weekly RSI has fallen to its most oversold level since the $15K bottom, suggesting potential for a contrarian bounce. However, Ethereum faced a massive high-impact outflow of $553 million from its ETF, creating a strong immediate bearish shock to market sentiment. Additionally, legal uncertainty persists with Terraform's $4B lawsuit against Jump Trading. Given that liquidity is not fully loose and high-impact bearish news (ETH outflow) dominates, the market is likely to remain in a **Cautious Consolidation** phase until the DXY trend reverses or outflows abate.",
