  "global_summary_cn": "宏观流动性状态为“风险偏好”（Risk On），受到美元指数走弱和日元套利交易稳定的支撑。然而，市场正处于“分歧”状态：尽管宏观环境积极且长期新闻叙事（巴西银行配置、英国监管清晰化）极为看涨，但比特币、以太坊和Solana在过去24小时内普遍回调。\n\n目前市场焦点集中在比特币90,000美元的盘整区，技术分析预测即将出现“挤压”。以太坊和Solana的资金费率已转为负值，表明存在大量空头头寸，一旦流动性进入或多头成功捍卫支撑，可能会触发强烈的空头挤压。BNB则逆势上涨，表现出显著的独立强势。",
  "global_summary_en": "The Macro Liquidity Layer suggests a 'Risk On' environment, supported by a weakening DXY and stable JPY carry trade conditions. However, the market is currently in a state of 'Divergence': despite supportive macro conditions and highly bullish long-term narratives (Brazil bank allocation, UK regulatory clarity), BTC, ETH, and SOL have generally retraced over the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket focus is centered on the $90,000 compression zone for Bitcoin, with technical narratives predicting an imminent 'Squeeze'. ETH and SOL funding rates have turned negative, indicating crowded short positions that could fuel a sharp short squeeze if liquidity enters or longs successfully defend support. BNB is notably decoupling and showing maximum strength.",
