  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：结构性宽松。市场正经历一场由利好宏观背景和强大的机构催化剂驱动的“完美风暴”（看涨）。结构上，美联储的鸽派倾向（降息预期持续走低）和日元的持续走弱（套利交易/风险偏好）为资产上涨提供了资金。叙事层面看涨情绪浓厚，核心催化剂是贝莱德提交质押型以太坊ETF的申请，这引发了鲸鱼的大规模做多，并导致了BTC和ETH的空头挤压（ETH在24小时内上涨8.66%，且RSI达到76.5的超买水平）。尽管DXY和VIX略有上升带来短期紧缩压力，但机构采纳的叙事和结构性宽松的主导地位，正在驱动资产价格无视短期阻力强势上涨。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Structurally Loose. The market is currently experiencing a \"Perfect Storm (Bullish)\" driven by a favorable macro backdrop and powerful institutional catalysts. Structurally, macro liquidity is loose: the Fed's dovish trend (falling rate expectations) and continued Yen weakness (Carry Trade/Risk On) provide underlying funding. The Narrative Layer is overwhelmingly bullish, catalyzed primarily by BlackRock's filing for a staked Ethereum ETF, triggering massive whale long bets and a major short squeeze in both BTC and ETH (ETH up 8.66% in 24h, reaching highly overbought RSI 76.5). Although DXY and VIX show mild short-term tightening pressure, the dominance of the institutional adoption narrative and structural liquidity easing are driving assets strongly upward, ignoring minor resistance.",
