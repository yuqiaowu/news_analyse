  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：全球流动性处于明显的“风险偏好”阶段。美联储降息预期下降、美元指数（DXY）走弱以及VIX维持低位（14.1）共同打开了全球资金水龙头。在宏观利好的背景下，加密市场叙事极度乐观，形成了接近“完美风暴”的看涨环境。\n\n比特币正逼近9万美元，市场评论其基本面“不能再好”，价格走势与宏观顺风完全一致。以太坊方面，尽管有看跌声音，但关于2026年ZK技术将实现指数级扩展的消息提供了强劲的长期催化剂，使得ETH价格在短期看跌分析面前表现出韧性（Divergence）。由于欧美多国银行休假，短期交易量可能会受到抑制，但整体风险偏好环境预计将持续支撑主要资产（BTC、ETH、SOL）继续上涨。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Global liquidity is clearly in a \"Risk-On\" phase. Dovish shifts in Fed rate expectations, a weakening DXY, and a low VIX (14.1) collectively signal the global money tap is opening. Against this favorable macro backdrop, the crypto market narrative is highly bullish, creating near \"Perfect Storm (Bullish)\" conditions.\n\nBitcoin is nearing $90,000, supported by market consensus that its fundamentals are excellent, aligning perfectly with macro tailwinds. For Ethereum, optimistic news regarding potential exponential scaling via ZK technology in 2026 provides a strong long-term catalyst, allowing ETH to show resilience against short-term bearish analyst calls (Divergence). Trading volumes may be suppressed due to numerous bank holidays across Europe and Canada, but the overall risk-on environment is expected to continue supporting major assets (BTC, ETH, SOL).",
