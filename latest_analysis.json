  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：全球宏观流动性偏向收紧/风险规避。DXY走强且VIX上升，显示传统市场趋于谨慎。尽管美联储降息预期下降（利好），但其影响被美元强势和VIX波动上升抵消。\n\n叙事合成：CPI数据显示通胀受控，原本是利好，但BTC在$90K附近未能守住，并伴随高达$553M的ETH ETF巨额流出警报。积极消息未能支撑价格，显示出强大的派发压力。宏观紧缩背景（流动性层）与利好不涨（叙事层）的结合，形成了“卖出反弹”的信号。市场结构目前脆弱，空头情绪在SOL等山寨币中尤为激进（负资金费率）。短期内应保持防御性。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Global macro liquidity is leaning towards tightening/Risk Off. The strengthening DXY and rising VIX indicate caution in traditional markets. Although Fed rate expectations dropped (Dovish/Bullish), this is countered by dollar strength and rising volatility.\n\nNarrative Synthesis: The supposedly cool CPI data, which was bullish, failed to push BTC past $90K and coincided with an alarming $553M ETH ETF outflow. Positive news failing to sustain the rally suggests strong distribution pressure. The combination of macro tightening (Liquidity Layer) and the 'Good News, No Rally' divergence (Narrative Layer) generates a 'Sell the Rally' signal. The market structure is currently fragile, with bearish sentiment aggressive in altcoins like SOL (evidenced by negative funding rates). Defensive positioning is advised in the short term.",
