  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：全球流动性处于宽松的风险偏好环境。宏观层面，美联储降息预期继续显著下降，美元指数（DXY）走弱，这提供了强劲的宏观利好支撑。\n\n市场分歧与策略：当前市场处于典型的“买入回调”（Buy the Dip）分歧阶段。尽管宏观流动性宽松且出现重磅的监管利好（如Circle、Ripple获批国家信托银行），但短期内市场正在经历强烈的去杠杆化（比特币、以太坊和Solana普遍下跌，并伴随着负融资费率）。这种价格下跌与宽松的流动性形成了背离，表明短期恐慌或清算正在被长期买家吸筹。策略上，在流动性支撑下，当前跌势是积累头寸的机会，尤其关注跌幅较大且资金费率为负的资产（如ETH）。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Global liquidity is loose, favoring a Risk-On environment. Macro indicators are highly supportive: Fed rate cut expectations are dropping significantly, and the DXY is weakening, providing strong tailwinds.\n\nDivergence and Strategy: The market is currently in a classic 'Buy the Dip' divergence phase. Despite favorable loose macro liquidity and strong structural news (e.g., Circle, Ripple securing National Trust Bank approvals), the market is undergoing intense short-term deleveraging (BTC, ETH, and SOL are down, accompanied by negative funding rates). This price weakness, counter to the loose liquidity, suggests short-term panic or liquidation is being absorbed by long-term buyers. The strategy should be accumulation during this dip, especially focusing on assets with large declines and deeply negative funding rates (like ETH), as the macro tide supports upward movement.",
