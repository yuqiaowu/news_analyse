  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：偏紧/混合对冲。宏观流动性信号处于混合状态，DXY走强和美债收益率上升构成了即时阻力，暗示全球资金偏向收紧。然而，市场正积极消化极度利好的叙事，特别是与以太坊ETF（贝莱德提交质押型ETH ETF申请）和机构采用（PNC银行提供BTC交易）相关的消息。这种流动性紧缩与叙事强劲的背离表明，当前的上涨是叙事驱动的，风险资产正在积极克服宏观阻力。如果宏观压力持续，市场可能面临获利了结，但目前强烈的机构需求主导了价格走势，尤其体现在ETH的强劲表现上。整体市场情绪为偏强牛市。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Cautiously Tight/Mixed Headwinds. Macro liquidity signals are mixed; a strengthening DXY and rising US 10Y yields present immediate headwinds, suggesting a general tightening bias. However, the market is aggressively digesting extremely bullish narratives, specifically surrounding Ethereum ETFs (BlackRock filed for a staked ETH ETF) and institutional adoption (PNC Bank launching BTC trading). This divergence—tightening liquidity countered by strong news—indicates that the current rally is narrative-driven, with risk assets actively fighting macro resistance. If macro pressures persist, the market may face distribution, but strong institutional demand is currently dominating price action, particularly evident in ETH’s performance. Overall market sentiment is strongly bullish.",
