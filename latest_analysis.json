  "global_summary_cn": "宏观流动性目前处于复杂且偏紧的状态。尽管美联储利率预期趋于鸽派，且CPI数据显示通胀降温（长期利好），但美元指数（DXY）走强以及VIX波动率的上升，表明短期市场风险偏好正在收紧。叙事层面出现了明显的“利好不涨”的分化，例如CPI数据公布后，加密市场未能跟随股市上涨，反而遭遇抛售压力。以太坊ETF出现5.53亿美元的大额流出，是导致市场整体疲软的关键因素。市场正处于对冲通胀降温的利好消息与即时流动性收紧之间的拉锯战。短期内，流动性收紧带来的风险大于利好叙事，需警惕下行风险，但长期采用（如Intuit/USDC）仍具支撑。",
  "global_summary_en": "Macro liquidity is currently complex and leaning slightly tight. Although Fed rate expectations are becoming Dovish and CPI data showed cooling inflation (long-term bullish), the strengthening US Dollar Index (DXY) and rising VIX indicate a short-term tightening of market risk appetite. A significant 'good news ignored' divergence is present in the narrative layer; after the CPI release, the crypto market failed to follow stocks higher and instead faced selling pressure. A massive $553 million outflow from an Ethereum ETF is a key factor contributing to overall market weakness. The market is caught between the long-term bullish narrative of cooling inflation and immediate liquidity tightening. Short-term risk driven by tightening liquidity outweighs the positive narrative, warranting caution regarding downside risks, though long-term adoption (e.g., Intuit/USDC) remains supportive.",
