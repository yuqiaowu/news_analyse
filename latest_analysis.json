  "global_summary_cn": "流动性状态：当前宏观流动性偏向宽松（美元指数DXY走弱，VIX低迷，美联储降息预期下调），但市场表现出明显的预警性抛售，价格普遍下跌2%左右。这种表现构成了一个显著的“熊市陷阱”或“逢低买入”的潜在机会。\n\n**双层分析合成**：当前宏观流动性宽松（Risk On），但市场叙事和价格走势却偏向看跌（Bearish Price Action），形成了**分歧**。市场正在消化或提前对本周高风险事件（如日本央行政策利率和美国CPI）带来的紧缩风险进行定价。特别是宏观分析师警告日本可能采取鹰派行动导致比特币跌破7万美元的言论，加剧了短期恐慌。由于RSI已接近超卖区域（35-40）且资金费率为负，如果即将到来的风险事件未恶化，技术性反弹的可能性较高。",
  "global_summary_en": "Liquidity Status: Current macro liquidity leans towards loosening (DXY weakening, VIX low, Fed rate expectations dropping), yet the market shows clear preemptive selling, with prices generally dropping around 2%. This action presents a classic potential 'Buy the Dip' setup or 'Bear Trap'.\n\n**Dual-Layer Synthesis**: We observe a **Divergence** where current macro liquidity is Loose (Risk On), but the market narrative and price action are Bearish (Prices dropping). The market appears to be pricing in or anticipating tightening risks from high-impact events this week (namely the BOJ Policy Rate and US CPI). Specifically, concerns about a hawkish Japan potentially driving BTC below $70K are fueling short-term fear. Given that RSIs are near oversold territory (35-40) and funding rates are negative, the potential for a technical rebound is high, provided the upcoming risk events are benign.",
